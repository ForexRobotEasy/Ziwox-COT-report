# Ziwox COT Report - Forex Trading Robot

## Description
This code represents a Forex trading robot that utilizes the Commitment of Traders (COT) report to analyze market trends and generate a comprehensive market report. The COT report provides data on the positions held by different categories of traders in the Forex market, such as commercial, non-commercial, and non-reportable traders.

The code extracts data from a COT report file in CSV format, classifies the traders based on their positions, calculates the total positions held by each category of traders, and generates a market report based on the trader positions.

## How It Works
1. The code starts by importing the necessary libraries for input/output operations, string manipulation, and vector data structure.

2. A TraderCategory enum is defined to represent the different categories of traders.

3. A TraderData struct is defined to store the trader category and position.

4. The `extractDataFromCOTReport` function takes a file path as input and returns a vector of TraderData objects. It opens the COT report file, reads and processes the data line by line, parses each line to extract the trader category and position, converts the category and position to their appropriate types, creates a TraderData object, and adds it to the vector. If an error occurs during file opening, invalid data parsing, or position conversion, error messages are displayed and the function returns an empty vector.

5. The `classifyTraders` function takes a vector of TraderData objects as input and classifies the traders based on their categories. It counts the number of traders in each category and displays the classification results.

6. The `calculatePositions` function takes a vector of TraderData objects as input and calculates the total positions held by each category of traders. It iterates through the traders, accumulates the positions based on the category, and displays the total positions.

7. The `generateMarketReport` function takes a vector of TraderData objects as input and generates a market report based on the trader positions. This function can be customized to add code that analyzes the positions and generates insights about market trends. Currently, it displays a placeholder message for the market report.

8. The main function is the entry point of the program. It specifies the COT report file path, calls the `extractDataFromCOTReport` function to extract the data from the COT report, calls the `classifyTraders` function to classify the traders, calls the `calculatePositions` function to calculate the positions, calls the `generateMarketReport` function to generate the market report, and returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

## Product Description
This code represents a sample Forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It utilizes the Commitment of Traders (COT) report to analyze market trends and generate a comprehensive market report. The COT report provides valuable insights into the positions held by different categories of traders, allowing traders to make informed decisions.

To use this code, traders need to provide a COT report file in CSV format. The code will then extract the data from the file, classify the traders based on their positions, calculate the total positions held by each category of traders, and generate a market report based on the trader positions.
